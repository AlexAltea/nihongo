		This website was made in a couple of painful hours: Waiting for the supermarket to open in order to buy more <abbr title="pizza">food</abbr>.<br/>
		Anyway, given the proverb that "<i>the best artist is a starving artist</i>" and the fact that coding is an art,<br/>
		what could possibly go wrong?

		About the website. It's just a collection of different tools:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Hiragana:</b> Learn to read (hiragana &rarr; romaji) and write (romaji &rarr; hiragana) it. <i>(Not finished)</i></li>
			<li><b>Katakana:</b> Learn to read (katakana &rarr; romaji) and write (romaji &rarr; katakana) it. <i>(Not finished)</i></li>
			<li><b>Vocabulary:</b> Translate the given words to japanese.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I included <i>Vocabulary</i> exercises from my german textbook (fair use of copyrighted material claimed),<br/>
		but you will be able to create/import/export your own training sets in the future.<br/>
		(Assuming the whole thing doesn't get abandoned or C&D'd first)
